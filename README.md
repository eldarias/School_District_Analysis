# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to perform a new analyzis of the School District and review the overall results to see the impact of removing data from a specific grade for a specific high school.  The new analysis data was kept intact except that the 9th grade reading and math scores at the Thomas High School were marked with NaN so they are not taken into account on the new analysis.
